This easy recipe comes together in 5 easy steps: 

1. Prepare the pudding. Now traditionally, custard is used, which has been replaced by instant pudding in recent times. The use of the instant pudding mix is convenient, especially when you donâ€™t want to turn on the stovetop. But if you love to make it from scratch, by all means, go ahead and do it.
2. Beat the condensed milk and softened cream cheese until smooth and free of lumps.
3. Add this cream cheese mixture to the pudding and mix everything well.
4. Fold in the whipped cream to lighten things up.
5. Assemble the pudding in a glass serving dish, trifle bowl, or in these cute serving glasses as Iâ€™ve done. I just think itâ€™s nice to have your own individual banana pudding cup. Makes for a gorgeous presentation to your guests!
6. Whether you assemble the pudding in a glass serving dish, trifle bowl or individual cups, you begin by placing a layer of cookies at the bottom, followed by slices of banana and then the pudding. Repeat until all the ingredients are used or as many layers as you want.

1. Cover the serving dish or cups with a cling film (this will avoid the pudding from absorbing other aromas in the refrigerator) and refrigerate for about 4-6 or 12 hours.

2. Banana pudding will stay well for 2-3 days in the refrigerator, only if lasts that long ðŸ˜€ Do not keep it longer than 3 days or else it tends to get runny.

3. This is seriously the best homemade banana pudding, soo quick and easy too. And serving it as individual banana pudding cups makes it look even fancier when in fact it is so easy!
